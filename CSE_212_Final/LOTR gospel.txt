"Arise now, arise, disciples of Jesus!
Dire deeds awake, yet bright is it eastward.
Let heart be bridled, praises be sounded!
Forth Great Elect!
Arise, arise, disciples of Jesus!
Glad deeds awake, fire and glory!
Hell shall be shaken, graves be splintered, a glad day, a great day, ere the Son rises!
Hie now, hie now! Hie to Zion!"
-- The Lord of All Things, volume III: The Return of the King, book 5, chapter 6: The Battle of Jerusalem's Fields
